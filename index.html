        <h1 id="about-me">About Me</h1>

<p>I am a sophomore student at the Indian Institute of Technology, 
Bombay. I'm pursuing my Bachelors at IIT Bombay in Electrical Engineering with a keen interest in Computer Science and Engineering.</p>

<p>Logic has been my hobby since I was a kid. I was introduced to the realm of prgramming in my freshman year and in a year and a half, I have learnt more than I ever did before. I was intrigued by the fact that a few characters here and there could automate processes and could make the machines function like a human mind.</p>

<p>I started learning machine learning, computer vision and natural language processing about six months back and was very intrigued by the field. To probe further, I completed courses on machine learning and computer vision on coursera. I learnt quite a few algorithms and experimented with projects. As I am pursuing electrical engineering, I am well versed with the knowledge of signal processing, semiconductor devices and ICs which catch my interest. I am currently working on an interdisciplinnary project which involves machine learning and audio processing.
</p>

<p>Apart from academics, which is obviously one of my hobbies, I am fond of sitting down and playing a piano for hours or binge watch a sci-fi or historical TV series. </p>

<h3 id="Chord Extractor">Chord Extractor</h3>
<p>I am currently working on this project under a competition India Innovation Challenge Design Contest '18, jointly organised by Texas Instruments and the Govt. of India. 
In this project I used machine learning based models to extract chords 
out of a music file. To complete this task I extracted 12 dimensional 
Pitch Class Profile vectors from audio file using Fourier 
Transformation. I achieved 95% training accuracy and 86% test accuracy 
on a dataset of 2000 chords. <a href="https://github.com/safwankdb/Chords-and-Beats-Extraction-using-ML">Here</a> is the github link to my project.</p>

<h3 id="Chat Platform">Heart Rate Monitor</h3>
<p>I completed this project during Spring Semester 2017 under <a href="https://www.cse.iitb.ac.in/~as/">Prof. Amitabh Sanyal</a>.
 I implemented a chat bot that uses Hill Encryption to encrypt and 
decrypt messages on the user end only and deployed various methods to 
keep the key visible only to the interacting users (not even to the 
system). I also made a chatbox so that users can keep track of their 
chats while interacting with other users. <a href="https://github.com/arpit-1110/End-to-End-Encrypted-Chat-platform">Here</a> is the github link. </p>
<h3 id="Movie Reviewer">Movie Reviewer</h3>
<p>I did this self project during summers and got it evaluated later by <a href="https://wncc-iitb.org/">Web and Coding Club, IIT bombay</a>.
 In this project I deployed a rating system based on comments of user on
 the movie. I used TextBlob library for this purpose and extracted 
Subjectivity and Polarity to use them as features to train them on 
neural network. I further regulated these values to obtain final star 
rating of the movie. <a href="https://github.com/arpit-1110/Movie_Reviewer/tree/add-license-1">Here</a> is the github link.

<!-- <h3 id="Deep Learning">Deep Learning on Cancer Tissue Analysis</h3>
<p>This was my first project in the direction of Machine Learning.I Learned deep learning and image processing for the analysis of cancer tissues under Prof.Amit Sethi at IIT Bombay in my freshman winter.I read literature of image processing in cancer cell and attended research group meetings.These meeting were highly informative and developed my liking for the feild.I then went on to implement algorithms to train and test on various data sets.</p> -->
